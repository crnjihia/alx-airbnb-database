# 🏨 ALX Airbnb Database Project

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program** and focuses on designing and implementing a scalable, relational database for an Airbnb-like application. It involves applying principles of database normalization, entity-relationship modeling, SQL schema definition, and realistic data seeding.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to design and build a fully normalized, production-ready database system that supports core Airbnb features such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives

- Design efficient and normalized relational database systems
- Create entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) to model real-world systems
- Normalize database schema to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**
- Write SQL scripts to:
  - Define tables and constraints (DDL)
  - Populate tables with sample data (DML)
- Collaborate professionally using GitHub and documentation standards

---

## 🗂️ Entities Modeled

- `Users`
- `Properties`
- `Bookings`
- `Payments`
- `Reviews`

Each table is designed with appropriate keys, constraints, and indexes for optimal performance and data integrity.

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL / MySQL
- SQL (DDL + DML)
- Draw.io (for ERD)
- GitHub

---

## ✅ Status

This project is actively being developed and refined. ERD and schema are in review, with seeding and indexing ongoing. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
